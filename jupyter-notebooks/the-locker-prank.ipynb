    "_There are 100 lockers that line the main hallway of Chelm High School. Every night, the school principal makes sure all the lockers are closed so that there will be an orderly start to the next day. One day, 100 mischievous students decide that they will play a prank. The students all meet before school starts and line up. The first student then walks down the hallway, and opens every locker. The next student follows by closing every other locker (starting at the second locker). Student 3 then goes to every third locker (starting with the third) and opens it if it’s closed, and closes it if it’s open. Student 4 follows by opening every fourth locker if it’s closed and closing it if it’s open. This goes on and on until Student 100 finally goes to the hundredth locker. When the principal arrives later in the morning, which lockers does she find open?_\n",

    "#### Brainstorming:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's think about each locker number's list of factors (e.g., locker 6 has factors 1, 2, 3, and 6 itself). Let's also think about the factors as _visitors_ -- because they are! What you may notice (perhaps after some time with pen/paper/whiteboard) is that Students 1, 2, 3, and 6 must visit Locker 6.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### First key realization:\n",
    "\n",
    "* If a locker is visited an even number of times, it has to be shut\n",
    "\n",
    "So, Locker 6 is definitely shut at the end of this prank.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Corollary:\n",
    "\n",
    "* If a locker is visited an odd number of times, it has to be open\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Third key realization:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Only perfect squares have an odd number of factors (visitors)\n",
    "    * Why? For instance, consider 9, which has factors 1, 3, and 9\n",
    "        * Important: Even when a factor is \"repeated\" as in $ 3 \\times 3 = 9$, it only counts as 1 factor!\n",
    "        * And there aren't two copies of Student 3, right?!\n",
    "        \n",
    "        \n",
    "#### Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "Only the Lockers with perfect squares for their numbers are left open. These are lockers\n",
