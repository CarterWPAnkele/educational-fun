# educational-fun

My repository for fun and games in collaboration with others. To include coding challenges, fun word problems solved efficiently by code, etc.
We will mainly use Python (and some markdown), but hope to add more languages over time!

## Coding Challenges
* [fizzbuzz](https://github.com/jordanrhall/educational-fun/blob/main/coding-challenges/fizzbuzz.py): A standard, brief challenge to efficiently print integers 1 through 100, with a few caveats Jordan took on to brush up on Python skills. [Thanks, Michael, for your help!](https://github.com/jordanrhall/educational-fun/issues/1)
* [Number Game](https://github.com/jordanrhall/educational-fun/blob/main/coding-challenges/Number_Guesser.py): A fun number guessing game Carter took on as his first Python challenge
* [Cake Sale](https://github.com/jordanrhall/educational-fun/blob/main/coding-challenges/Cake_Sale_Challenge.py): Carter's second Python challenge, involving some sugary goodness

## Markdown Practice
* A [thank you note](https://github.com/jordanrhall/educational-fun/blob/main/markdown-practice/thanks.md): A note Payton left for Jordan to practice using the repo locally
* Some [basic math commands](https://github.com/jordanrhall/educational-fun/blob/main/markdown-practice/basic-math-commands.md): Rough draft demo of using math mode
