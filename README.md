# educational-fun

My repository for fun and games. To include coding challenges, fun word problems solved efficiently by code, etc.
I will mainly use Python, but hope to add more over time!

## So far:
* Fizzbuzz: A standard, brief challenge to efficiently print integers 1 through 100, with a few caveats
* Added a [thank you note](https://github.com/prose11/educational-fun/blob/main/thanks.md) to practice using the repo locally
