# educational-fun

My repository for fun and games in collaboration with others. To include coding challenges, fun word problems solved efficiently by code, etc.
We will mainly use Python (and some markdown), but hope to add more languages over time!

## Contents

### Coding Challenges
* [Fizzbuzz](https://github.com/jordanrhall/educational-fun/blob/main/coding-challenges/fizzbuzz.py): A standard challenge to efficiently print integers 1 through 100, with a few caveats. Jordan took this on to brush up on Python skills and get this repo going. [Thanks, Michael, for your help and inspiration!](https://github.com/jordanrhall/educational-fun/issues/1)
* [Number Guessing Game](https://github.com/jordanrhall/educational-fun/blob/main/coding-challenges/Number_Guesser.py): A fun number guessing game Carter took on as his first Python challenge
* [Cake Sale](https://github.com/jordanrhall/educational-fun/blob/main/coding-challenges/Cake_Sale_Challenge.py): Carter's second Python challenge, involving some sugary goodness

### Jupyter Notebooks
* [The Locker Prank](https://github.com/jordanrhall/educational-fun/blob/main/jupyter-notebooks/the-locker-prank.ipynb): A fun challenge Jordan found in Popular Mechanics solved in a Jupyter Notebook

### Markdown Practice
* A [thank you note](https://github.com/jordanrhall/educational-fun/blob/main/markdown-practice/thanks.md): A kind note Payton left for Jordan to practice a GitHub workflow
* [Displaying math in Markdown](https://github.com/jordanrhall/educational-fun/blob/main/markdown-practice/displaying-math.md): Jordan's brief demo of properly displaying math equations in GitHub-rendered Markdown
